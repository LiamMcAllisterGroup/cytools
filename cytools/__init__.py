    **Description:**
    Checks for updates of CYTools. It prints a message if a new version is
    avaiable, and displays a warning if the current version has a serious bug.

    **Arguments:**
    None.

    **Returns:**
    Nothing.

    **Example:**
    We check for updates of CYTools. This is done automatically, so there is
    usually no need to do this.
    ```python {2}
    import cytools
    cytools.check_for_updates()
