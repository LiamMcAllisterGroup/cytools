    **Description:**
    Sets a custom path to the Mosek license. This is useful if the Docker image
    was built without the license, but it is stored somewhere in your computer.
    The license will be checked after the new path is set.

    **Arguments:**
    - `path` *(str)*: The path to the Mosek license. Note that the mounted
        directory on the Docker container is `/home/cytools/mounted_volume/`.

    **Returns:**
    Nothing.

    **Example:**
    We set the path to the original one for illustation purposes, and show how
    to set the path to a directory on the host computer.

    import cytools
    cytools.config.set_mosek_path("/opt/cytools/external/mosek/mosek.lic") # Original path
