CYTools is an open-source software package that relies on various other software packages built for Unix-like systems. It is primarily distributed in the form of a conda environment.

We provide simple installation and usage instructions for the major operating systems. These are meant for most users, as they allow you to install and use CYTools without having to memorizing long commands.
