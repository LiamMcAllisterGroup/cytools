    "Let us now look at a full example computation. For this, let's reproduce some of the results of the paper __The Kreuzer-Skarke Axiverse__ \\[[1808.01282](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01282)\\]. In particular, we will reproduce figures 1, 3, 4, and 8(a). We will be using a much smaller set of polytopes so that the code only takes a few minutes to run. Consequently, so the spread of the distributions will not be as large, but it is clear that they match. To more closely match the procedure used in the paper we will only construct a single triangulation per polytope using TOPCOM. However, we will also show how to sample triangulations for each polytope.\n",

    "As we previously mentioned, in this example we restricted to finding only a single triangulation per polytope with TOPCOM, as this is how the original analysis was done. However, with CYTools we can do better, as there are functions to sample triangulations from polytopes. Let us redo the above computation, but now picking a small set of triangulations obtained by randomly picking heights, which is done by the [`random_triangulations_fast`](https://cy.tools/docs/documentation/polytope#random_triangulations_fast) function. However, keep in mind that this does not produce a fair sampling of triangulations. For a fair sampling, one should using the much slower [`random_triangulations_fair`](https://cy.tools/docs/documentation/polytope#random_triangulations_fair) function. However, for demonstration purposes, as well as for other applications like machine learning, a fast sampling of triangulations is sufficient.\n",

    "The above example shows the power of CYTools. The original paper required very significant effort to assemble the code for the analysis, as it required downloading the KS database, performing some computations on SageMath, then performing some extra computations in Mathematica, and finally using a variety of scripts to gather together all the data. Now, anyone can perform the full analysis with a few lines of code in CYTools. Although we only took a small number of polytopes in this example, one could easily increase the range of the scan and even surpass the statistics of the original paper by running the computation on a standard laptop overnight.\n",
